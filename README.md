Our client is  a WA university sales and marketing department manage

Project proposal:
WA university is planning their courses to run. They have come to us and want to work with us to find out what courses will be popular in the next few years. 

To predict the in-demand course/qualifications, we will look at data regarding the growing industries, income levels of different qualifications and occupations. Our main source of data comes from ABS. 

Our plan is to work on the data on a 5 years period and exclude data in FY2020 because this year the world went the covid-19 pendemic. We will use the data from the growing industries to extract 5 industries to work on. Then will move to the income data of qualifications and occupations and filter the data to match up the top 5 industries. 

The end result will be showing WA university the indemand occupations so that can set up courses occordingly.
